# Security & Teacher-Student Isolation Fixes

## Overview
Fixed critical security vulnerabilities where teachers could access other teachers' student data and modules. The system now properly isolates data by teacher (admin_id).

## Security Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. Students API (`api/students.php`)
**Issue:** Returned ALL students from the database, regardless of which teacher was logged in.
**Fix:** 
- Added authentication check (`$_SESSION['admin_id']`)
- Added SQL filter: `WHERE admin_id = ?`
- Now only returns students belonging to the logged-in teacher

### 2. Modules API (`api/modules.php`) 
**Issue:** Returned ALL modules from the database, regardless of which teacher created them.
**Fix:**
- Added authentication check (`$_SESSION['admin_id']`)
- Added SQL filter: `WHERE admin_id = ?` 
- Now only returns modules created by the logged-in teacher

### 3. Update Progress API (`api/update-progress.php`)
**Issue:** Could update ANY student's progress by LRN, even students from other teachers.
**Fix:**
- Added authentication check (`$_SESSION['admin_id']`)
- Added student ownership verification: `WHERE lrn = ? AND admin_id = ?`
- Now only allows progress updates for the teacher's own students

### 4. Reset Progress API (`api/reset-progress.php`)
**Issue:** Could reset ANY student's progress by LRN, even students from other teachers.
**Fix:**
- Added authentication check (`$_SESSION['admin_id']`)
- Added student ownership verification: `WHERE lrn = ? AND admin_id = ?`
- Now only allows progress resets for the teacher's own students

### 5. Get Module Assessment API (`api/get-module-assessment.php`)
**Issue:** Students could access modules from any teacher, not just their assigned teacher.
**Fix:**
- Added cross-reference check between student's `admin_id` and module's `admin_id`
- Students can now only access modules created by their assigned teacher

### 6. Take Assessment API (`api/take-assessment.php`)
**Issue:** Students could submit assessments for modules from any teacher.
**Fix:**
- Added cross-reference check between student's `admin_id` and module's `admin_id`
- Students can now only submit assessments for modules from their assigned teacher

## Database Structure Validation

The database properly supports teacher-student isolation with these foreign key relationships:
- `students.admin_id` ‚Üí `admins.id` (links student to their teacher)
- `modules.admin_id` ‚Üí `admins.id` (links module to its creator teacher)
- `assessments.student_id` ‚Üí `students.id` (links assessment to student)
- `assessments.module_id` ‚Üí `modules.id` (links assessment to module)

## Authentication Flow

1. Teachers log in via `api/admin-login.php`
2. Session stores: `$_SESSION['admin_id']` and `$_SESSION['username']`
3. All subsequent API calls verify `$_SESSION['admin_id']` 
4. Data queries are filtered by the teacher's `admin_id`

## Testing

Created `test-security-isolation.php` to verify:
- Teachers only see their own students
- Teachers only see their own modules  
- Cross-teacher access is properly blocked
- Database relationships are correctly enforced

## Security Benefits

‚úÖ **Data Privacy:** Teachers cannot see other teachers' students
‚úÖ **Module Protection:** Teachers cannot access other teachers' modules
‚úÖ **Progress Isolation:** Teachers cannot modify other teachers' students' progress
‚úÖ **Assessment Security:** Students can only access modules from their assigned teacher
‚úÖ **Authentication Required:** All sensitive operations require valid teacher login

## Next Steps

1. **Test Frontend:** Verify admin dashboard works correctly with new authentication
2. **Student Login:** Ensure student login and module access still works
3. **Error Handling:** Test error responses for unauthorized access attempts
4. **Role Management:** Consider implementing super admin vs regular teacher roles
5. **Audit Logging:** Add logging for sensitive operations

## Files Modified

- `api/students.php` - Added teacher authentication and filtering
- `api/modules.php` - Added teacher authentication and filtering  
- `api/update-progress.php` - Added student ownership verification
- `api/reset-progress.php` - Added student ownership verification
- `api/get-module-assessment.php` - Added teacher-student-module cross-validation
- `api/take-assessment.php` - Added teacher-student-module cross-validation
- `test-security-isolation.php` - Created comprehensive security test

## Critical Security Achievement

üîí **BEFORE:** Any teacher could see ALL students and modules in the system
üîê **AFTER:** Teachers can ONLY see their own students and modules

This fix prevents data breaches and ensures proper privacy between different teachers' classes.
