   - System analytics and reporting

9. **User Experience**
   - Email notifications for assessments
   - Forgot password functionality
   - Better feedback messages

## 🧪 **Required Testing Before Production**

### **Functional Testing**
- [ ] Teacher registration → login → dashboard
- [ ] Student registration → login → take assessment
- [ ] Module creation → PDF upload → assessment creation
- [ ] Cross-teacher isolation (security critical!)
- [ ] File upload limits and validation
- [ ] Database operations under load

### **Security Testing**
- [ ] SQL injection protection
- [ ] File upload vulnerabilities
- [ ] Session hijacking prevention
- [ ] Cross-teacher data access (our recent fixes)
- [ ] XSS prevention in user inputs

### **Performance Testing**
- [ ] Multiple concurrent users
- [ ] Large PDF file uploads
- [ ] Database performance with many students
- [ ] Mobile device compatibility

## 🚀 **Production Deployment Checklist**

### **Infrastructure Setup**
- [ ] Web server configuration (Apache/Nginx)
- [ ] PHP production settings (error reporting off)
- [ ] MySQL production database
- [ ] SSL certificate for HTTPS
- [ ] Domain name and DNS setup

### **Security Hardening**
- [ ] Remove debug files (`debug.php`, `test-*.php`)
- [ ] Set secure file permissions
- [ ] Configure firewall rules
- [ ] Enable HTTPS redirect
- [ ] Secure database credentials

### **Monitoring & Maintenance**
- [ ] Error logging setup
- [ ] Database monitoring
- [ ] Backup automation
- [ ] Update procedures

## 📋 **Immediate Next Steps**

### **1. Fix Database Connection (CRITICAL)**
```bash
# Start MySQL in XAMPP
# Test connection via: http://localhost/tms/remediation-web/switch-database.php?action=test
```

### **2. Complete Security Testing**
```bash
# Test our teacher isolation fixes
# Verify file upload security
# Check session management
```

### **3. Production Environment Setup**
```bash
# Choose hosting provider
# Set up production database
# Configure domain and SSL
```

## 🎯 **Recommendation**

### **Current Status: 70% Ready** 

**✅ READY FOR:**
- Internal testing with real teachers/students
- Controlled pilot program
- Development/staging environment

**❌ NOT READY FOR:**
- Public production deployment
- Unsupervised use with sensitive data
- High-traffic scenarios

### **Time to Production: 1-2 weeks**

**Priority Actions:**
1. **Fix database connectivity** (1-2 days)
2. **Complete security testing** (2-3 days) 
3. **Production environment setup** (3-5 days)
4. **Final testing and deployment** (2-3 days)

## 🔧 **Quick Fixes Needed Now**

### **Fix Database Driver Issue**
The "could not find driver" error suggests PHP MySQL extension is not enabled.

**Solution:**
1. Check XAMPP → PHP → Config → php.ini
2. Uncomment: `extension=mysqli` and `extension=pdo_mysql`
3. Restart Apache
4. Test connection
